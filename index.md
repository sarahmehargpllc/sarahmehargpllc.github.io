**Welcome!** Thank you for considering me as your therapist. Take a look at my website to learn more about me and my practice.

I also offer introductory phone conversations at no cost. This brief chat is intended to help you determine if you'd feel we'd be a good match. The therapeutic relationship is the strongest indicator of a positive outcome in terms of therapy and I encourage anyone seeking a therapist to take this into account. You can [e-mail](mailto:sarahmeharg@gmail.com) me to schedule a time to talk. 

Sometimes life changes because of the choices we make and sometimes life changes anyway. The necessary adjustments often challenge our coping skills and what used to work no longer does. Therapy presents an opportunity to gain insight, learn, and practice new skills in a supportive and non-judgmental atmosphere.
