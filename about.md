I am a Licensed Independent Clinical Social Worker (LICSW) in the District of Columbia. I received my Bachelor of Science in Psychology from Mary Washington College and my Master degree in Social Work with a clinical focus from nearby Catholic University of America.  I have spent the majority of my career living and working in Ward 5 and I am excited to continue offering therapeutic services in this community. 

I have experience providing individual and group psychotherapy in an outpatient mental health clinic and a psychiatric rehabilitation program. In addition, I have provided crisis stabilization services to children and adolescents involved with the District of Columbia's child welfare system. 

My therapeutic approach is client-centered, strengths-based, and solution-focused. We will collaboratively identify treatment goals as well as the steps to reach them. I also integrate Cognitive Therapy including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Motivational Interviewing. I believe that insight must be accompanied by the skills to make and maintain change. 

In order to continue my professional development, I participate on ongoing trainings, continuing education, and consultation.
